Guru
====

Guru is the open source version of StudioJoy, a SaaS member management solution for Martial Arts Studios. Guru was my initial 'working name' so I chose to leave it when open sourcing.

**Update (11/17/2019):** This project has been archived and is not guaranteed to run given the dependencies are very much out of date. It purely exists for example code purposes.
